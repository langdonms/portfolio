# Updating my portfolio
### Why?
I'm recreating my portfolio site from scratch. It's currently hosted at https://langdonsanders.com built with WordPress theme that not require any custom code and has a dated aesthetic.

### Goals
 * refresh the aesthetic design and usability of my site
 * improve web design skills through practice
 * learn new modules for image hosting and galleries

### Requirements
 * responsive
 * easy to read
 * intuitive to navigate
 * expandable for future projects

## Approach

* Diving right in.  
   At first I started with a basic HTML page and tried to recreate my print resume using Bootstrap. This was great to start feeling like I was making progress but quickly realized I needed a more strategic approach.    
* Reading portfolio revision blogs  
* Collecting my thoughts in a sketch pad for. . .   
   layouts, colors, value, audience
* Start exploring frameworks that already established best practices 

### Explore frameworks

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)  
   I'm familiar with this when creating wedding invitation website. Responsive, easy to use.

* [Material Design](https://material.io/develop/)  
   Great design qualities with emphasis on usability. A great opportunity to try learning a new framework.
