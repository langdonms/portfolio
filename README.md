# Updating my portfolio
### Why?
I'm recreating my portfolio site from scratch. It's currently hosted at https://langdonsanders.com built with WordPress theme that not require any custom code and has a dated aesthetic.

### Goals
 * refresh the aesthetic design and usability of my site
 * improve web design skills through practice
 * learn new modules for image hosting and galleries

### Requirements
 * responsive
 * easy to read
 * intuitive to navigate
 * expandable for future projects
